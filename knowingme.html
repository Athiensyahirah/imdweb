            My name is Fatin Syahirah binti Ahmad Hamidi. I am a student from Universiti 
            Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Negeri Sembilan located in the Rembau Branch. Here, I took a study subject 
            with the theme of Computing, Informatics and Media Studies. Basically, this study subject will look 
            difficult for those who are not interested in learning more about it, but for those who are interested 
            in this study subject, this study subject is not as difficult as expected. This is because, with guidance 
            and guidance from lecturers and friends, all learning processes will be easy as the Arab proverb 
            says,<font color="purple"><b><i>"Man Jadda, Wa Jadda"</i></b></font> which means, anyone who works hard 
            will get the result.
        </p>

        <<p style="text-align: center; color:black; font-size: 30px;">
            On 3 January 2003 I was born at Seremban General Hospital or now better known as Tuanku 
            Jaafar Hospital (HTJ) in Seremban. I am the second child of 5 siblings consisting of three girls and two boys. Although 
            our family life is simple, we live in a harmonious and happy family. The level of education I have achieved 
            at this point is Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), and then with great hope, I will be holding a diploma roll 
            soon which will surely make both parents proud of the achievement of this one of their children. Although |
            the diploma level is not comparable to those who successfully completed a doctorate of philosophy (PHD), 
            this has also made me proud because it was not easy to complete the five semesters of my diploma. This is 
            because, there are many things that I have gone through that make me mentally and physically tired but with 
            the help and encouragement from my family and friends, I am able to get through it.
